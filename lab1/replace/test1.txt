Ayy
Thinkin' as I count these fuckin' days (Fuckin' days, bitch), ayy
Tell me if I'm lookin' better (Lookin' better)
Just the other night I was playin' with this Beretta (This Beretta)
I've just been so fed up (Been so fed up), ayy, ayy
My mama said I'm actin' kinda different (Kinda different)
It's probably all the shit that I've been missin' (I've been missin')
I don't tell nobody 'cause I don't do any bitchin' (Ayy)
'Cause that's when all these niggas catch you slippin', ayy
Hope I find the truth while I'm alive (While I'm alive)
Before I fuckin' die (Before I die)
